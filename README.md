## Deploying hi

[![Deploy](https://www.herokucdn.com/deploy/button.svg)](https://heroku.com/deploy?template=https://github.com/jacklul/inlinegamesbot)

Assuming everything was entered correctly the deploy process should run the following commands automatically and your bot should be instantly working:
- `php bin/console install` - install database schema
- `php bin/console set` - set the webhook

If it doesn't you will have to open your app's console and run them manually.

If you have verified Heroku account you will also want to add **Heroku Scheduler** addon and set up a hourly task to run the following command to clean up expired games from the database:
- `php bin/console cron`

## Note on translations

Translations support is implemented but it is not used mainly because translated text would be displayed to both players - this could be problematic in "gaming" groups - people setting language that other player can't understand!
